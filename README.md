This is a passion project that I've been working . It takes ideas from Convolutional Neural Networks, 
Image Segmenations, Computer Vision Feature Engineering, Signal Processing, Signal Filtering, and theres lots more to come!

I've implemented a Labeling Tool using ideas from Yutaloh's Eye Tracker and Tkinter. The current tflite model can accurately detect pupil positions at around ~20 fps.

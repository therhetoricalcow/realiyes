This is a passion project that I've been working on since the start of college. It takes ideas from Convolutional Neural Networks, 
Image Segmenations, Computer Vision Feature Engineering, Signal Processing, Signal Filtering, and theres lots more to come!

So far I've implemented a Labeling Tool Using ideas from Yutaloh's Eye Tracker and Tkinter. It's pretty simple but it outputs saved Images Output Segmentation in the Folder.
